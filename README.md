# EduCraftCopilot
Effortlessly Craft High-Quality Online Courses with AI


### Getting Started: Step-by-Step Guide
Set Up the Backend:

Clone the repository or create the project structure as outlined.
Install dependencies and configure environment variables.
Implement the models, routes, and services.
Test API endpoints using tools like Postman.
Set Up the Frontend:

Initialize the React project.
Create components and services to interact with the backend.
Implement authentication if necessary.
Test the user interface and ensure it communicates correctly with the backend.
Set Up the Mobile App:

Initialize the React Native project.
Create screens and services similar to the frontend.
Ensure mobile-specific optimizations and testing.
Develop the Chrome Extension:

Create the manifest.json and necessary scripts.
Develop the popup interface and integrate with the backend.
Test the extension locally before publishing.
Integrate AI Services:

Obtain API keys for Gemini and Sarvam.
Implement functions to interact with these APIs in the backend.
Ensure proper error handling and data management.
Deploy the Application:

Choose cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting.
Set up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
Ensure scalability and performance optimizations.
Test and Iterate:

Conduct thorough testing across all platforms.
Gather feedback from potential users.
Iterate on features and fix any issues.

### Backend Setup (Node.js with Express.js)
1. Initialize the Backend Project
```
mkdir EduCraft-Copilot
cd EduCraft-Copilot
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose dotenv axios cors
```

### Frontend Setup (React.js)
Initialize the Frontend Project
```
cd ..
npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm install axios react-router-dom
```

### Initialize the Mobile Project
```
cd ..
npx react-native init mobile
cd mobile
npm install axios react-navigation
```

- Create Service for API Calls
Similar to the frontend React services, create API services for the mobile app.

- Create Screens and Components
Example: CreateCourseScreen


### Additional Resources and Recommendations
Version Control: Use Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab to manage your codebase.
Authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms using libraries like JWT or OAuth.
Storage Services: Utilize AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for managing multimedia assets.
Real-Time Features: Implement WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.io) for real-time collaboration.
UI/UX Design: Use design tools like Figma to prototype and design intuitive interfaces.
Testing: Implement both unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for future development and onboarding.

### Conclusion
While this overview and the provided code snippets offer a solid foundation for developing the EduCraft Copilot, building a fully functional application will require substantial development effort across multiple areas. I recommend breaking down the project into manageable tasks, prioritizing core functionalities, and iteratively developing and testing each component.
